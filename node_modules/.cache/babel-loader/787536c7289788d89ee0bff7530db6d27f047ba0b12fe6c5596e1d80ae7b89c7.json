Created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto,\n          he is portrayed as a citizen of the Mushroom Kingdom and is one of Princess Peach's most loyal\n          attendants; constantly working on her behalf. He is usually seen as a non-player character (NPC)\n          who provides assistance to Mario and his friends in most games, but there are times when Toad(s)\n          takes center stage and appears as a protagonist, as seen in Super Mario Bros. 2, Wario's Woods,\n          Super Mario 3D World, and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Source:{' '}\n          <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toad_(Nintendo)\" target=\"_blank\">\n            Wikipedia\n          </a>\n        </p>\n      </TabPanel>\n    </Tabs>\n  );\n  \n  render(Component);"],"mappings":";;AAAA,MAAMA,SAAS,gBACXC,OAAA,CAACC,IAAI;EAAAC,QAAA,gBACHF,OAAA,CAACG,OAAO;IAAAD,QAAA,gBACNF,OAAA,CAACI,GAAG;MAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;IAAK;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAM,eAChBR,OAAA,CAACI,GAAG;MAACK,QAAQ;MAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;IAAK;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAM,eACzBR,OAAA,CAACI,GAAG;MAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;IAAK;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAM,eAChBR,OAAA,CAACI,GAAG;MAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;IAAK;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAM,eAChBR,OAAA,CAACI,GAAG;MAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;IAAI;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAM;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACP,eAEVR,OAAA,CAACU,QAAQ;IAAAR,QAAA,gBACPF,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAAK;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,MAAE,eAAAR,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAAwC;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,OAAG,eAAAR,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MACrC;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,qfAOpC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAI,eACJR,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,GAAG,SACM,EAAC,GAAG,eACXF,OAAA;QAAGW,IAAI,EAAC,qCAAqC;QAACC,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;QAAAV,QAAA,EAAC;MAE9D;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACF;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACK,eACXR,OAAA,CAACU,QAAQ;IAAAR,QAAA,gBACPF,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAAK;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,MAAE,eAAAR,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAA2C;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,OAAG,eAAAR,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MACnD;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,0VAIzB;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAI,eACJR,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,GAAG,SACM,EAAC,GAAG,eACXF,OAAA;QAAGW,IAAI,EAAC,qCAAqC;QAACC,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;QAAAV,QAAA,EAAC;MAE9D;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACF;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACK,eACXR,OAAA,CAACU,QAAQ;IAAAR,QAAA,gBACPF,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAAc;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,MAAE,eAAAR,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAAqD;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,0ZAMrF;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAI,eACJR,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,GAAG,SACM,EAAC,GAAG,eACXF,OAAA;QAAGW,IAAI,EAAC,8CAA8C;QAACC,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;QAAAV,QAAA,EAAC;MAEvE;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACF;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACK,eACXR,OAAA,CAACU,QAAQ;IAAAR,QAAA,gBACPF,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAAK;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,MAAE,eAAAR,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAAsB;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,OAAG,eAAAR,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAA4B;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,kpBASnF;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAI,eACJR,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,GAAG,SACM,EAAC,GAAG,eACXF,OAAA;QAAGW,IAAI,EAAC,qCAAqC;QAACC,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;QAAAV,QAAA,EAAC;MAE9D;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACF;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACK,eACXR,OAAA,CAACU,QAAQ;IAAAR,QAAA,gBACPF,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAAI;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,MAAE,eAAAR,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAA+B;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,wkBAOrD;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAI,eACJR,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,GAAG,SACM,EAAC,GAAG,eACXF,OAAA;QAAGW,IAAI,EAAC,+CAA+C;QAACC,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;QAAAV,QAAA,EAAC;MAExE;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACF;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACK;AAAA;EAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;EAAAC,UAAA;EAAAC,YAAA;AAAA,QAEd;AAEDK,MAAM,CAACd,SAAS,CAAC"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
